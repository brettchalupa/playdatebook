## How to Use

The source code for each chapter is broken down into a different folder for each section in the chapter. This helps people follow along with how the game being made is evolving with each non-trivial change. Within each chapter folder, you'll find the folders in order as the game evolves.

Here's how to build an example game from chapter 2:

```console
pdc c2-tennis/c2-tennis17/source tennis.pdx
```

You can then run `tennis.pdx` on the Playdate Simulator and on your console.
